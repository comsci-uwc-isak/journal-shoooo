Define: nonrepudiation

Nonrepudiation simply means that in legal terms, one party cannot reject the validity of a certain action or claim of other parties. 

Nonrepudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny something. Typically, nonrepudiation refers to the ability to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated. 

Nonrepudiation ensures the integrity of data all across the internet. In blockchain, digital signature, decentralized database, public and private cryptography help establish nonrepudiation, allowing users to make transactions safely.
