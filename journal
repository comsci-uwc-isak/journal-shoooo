We worked on creating VPN server on Raspberry Pi which did not go so well. 
I also consulted about my IA with Dr. Ruben to make sure that everything is on track.

We did a presentation on VPN using Raspberry Pi. Although our attempt to create VPN connection did not succeed, we showed the process of attempts. 
Worked on IA (login system) in order to ensure that user information is secured safely.
Topic 3 is a lot to remember

We worked on encryption tool website which encrypts user inputs in order to secure the information.
I have experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I have no idea about internet security, and it was a great opportunity to know more about it.

We worked on coffeescript which enables users to write javascript in easier manner. Because I am so used to the syntax of standard Javascript, this felt weird, but the code looks so much more cleaner.
We also tried some writing that we would do during tests. Questions were 3 IB style writing questions. Although these answers felt a little bit basic and simple, it is still difficult to write what IB exactly wants.
As I have been doing terribly on IB tests even though I understand the contents, I would like to practice more on the writing skills of IB tests.
