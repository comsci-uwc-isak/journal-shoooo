We worked on creating VPN server on Raspberry Pi which did not go so well. 
I also consulted about my IA with Dr. Ruben to make sure that everything is on track.

Reflection for 9/12/2019
We continued to work on our VPN on Raspberry Pi. 
Next class will be presentation on what we discovered and learned.
Still working on IA...

Reflection for 9/13/2019
We did a presentation on VPN using Raspberry Pi. Although our attempt to create VPN connection did not succeed, we showed the process of attempts. 
Worked on IA (login system) in order to ensure that user information is secured safely.
Topic 3 is a lot to remember

We worked on encryption tool website which encrypts user inputs in order to secure the information.
I have experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I have no idea about internet security, and it was a great opportunity to know more about it.

We worked on coffeescript which enables users to write javascript in easier manner. Because I am so used to the syntax of standard Javascript, this felt weird, but the code looks so much more cleaner.
We also tried some writing that we would do during tests. Questions were 3 IB style writing questions. Although these answers felt a little bit basic and simple, it is still difficult to write what IB exactly wants.
As I have been doing terribly on IB tests even though I understand the contents, I would like to practice more on the writing skills of IB tests.

Today, I worked on my IA especially on the website.
Things that I need to work on are: recording system, login system, and the main website that will provide users access to Augmented reality.

We took a test on Topic 3: Internet today. Although the contents felt fairly easy and something I already knew, but I have been messing up every test in CS class, so my expectation is pretty low.

We got our test results back which was dispressing and disappointing. However, since I already have 4 in CS class, there is only going up from this point.
I also submitted my task about getting statistics of our test results. I thought I cannot use libraries but apparently not. So that was great.
Happy that I don't have to code in Java.

//code
var values = [21, 33, 26, 39, 28, 32.5, 18.5, 27, 31.5, 29, 26.5, 31.5, 24, 35.5, 22.5, 25, 25.5, 19];
var sum =0;

var getAvg = function() {
    for (let i=0;i<values.length;i++){
        sum += values[i];
    }
    let mean = sum/values.length;
    return mean;
};

var bubbleSort = function() {
    for (let i=0;i<values.length;i++) {
        for (let j=0;j<values.length;j++) {
            if (values[j]>values[j+1]) {
                let temp = values[j];
                values[j] = values[j+1];
                values[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return bubbleSort;
};

var getMed = function() {
    bubbleSort();
    let mid = values.length/2;
    return values[mid];
}

var getQuartile = function(pos) {
    let index = values.length * pos;
    if(index % 1 != 0) {
        indexUp = Math.ceil(index);
        indexDown = Math.floor(index);
        total = values[indexUp-1] + values[indexDown-1];
        ans = total/2;
        return ans;
    } else {
        return values[index];
    }
}

var getIQR = function() {
    IQR = getQuartile(0.75) - getQuartile(0.25);
    return IQR;
}

console.log(getAvg());
console.log(getMed());
console.log(getQuartile(0.25));
console.log(getQuartile(0.75));
console.log(getIQR());

Today, we watched a cartoon show called The Magic School Bus. The episode was about network and it had almost all the components of Topic 3: Network. 
Dr. Ruben gave HL students a task to do which is to recreate the parking lot system. It seems pretty hard...

Reflection for 11/22/2019
We had a presentation on control system examples in real world such as traffic lights, elevator, and taxi meter. 
Input, output, actuator, sensors, feedback loop, control rules, etc.
We also went over size, price, clock and application of microcontroller, microprocessor, PLC, FPGA and GPU.
